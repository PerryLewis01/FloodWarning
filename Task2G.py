"""Flood Warning System

returns either, "high" "moderate" or "low" risk of flooding

probability of flooding is computed via a range of inputs,
current level over the typical maximum, the higher the current
level the higher the assumed risk of flooding (if in flood flood level high)

relative level, if the level is relatively high a similar equation is used
